My first preview of the HTML website project shows my attempt at creating a skeleton of the homepage of the multi-page project that acts as a travel guide. My travel guide is going to be a food guide to those that are going to be traveling in Japan or even as an informational website that shows the various food eateries all across the different regions in Japan. My preview shows a basic introduction page that introduces the purpose of the website to the audience. There is a heading with the title of my web series “Exploring Japan: One Bite at a Time”, and different headings that ask questions that the audience might have about my website. My aim was to keep the introduction short and sweet (few words) and use images and descriptions to do most of the explaining. The main website is going to act as a starting point, where the audience can click on the “Start!!” button to be guided to another HTML page with different regions of Japan and its food that they can explore. Then, once the audience clicks on a region (City) that they want to explore, they will click on the name of the region, and it will lead the audience to another web page dedicated to that sole region that they chose. Then there will be hyperlinks that refer the viewer back to either the introduction screen or the selection screen to start over or study different regions. I used red and white colors on my “Start!!” button using CSS in order to reflect Japan’s national colors and the pages will keep that color theme throughout. I utilized <em> and <strong> to italicize and/or bold certain words to help make a point in my HTML file for my introduction page.
