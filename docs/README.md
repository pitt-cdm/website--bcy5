Website Portfolio Project:

My website porfolio is a mini food guide to those that are planning on visiting Japan, or just have a general interest of Japanese food! I picked 3-4 popular food items in each of 4 major Japanese cities and provided images and a short description of the food items as well as images of popular landmarks and scenary in those respective cities.
