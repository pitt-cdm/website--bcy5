      own unique twist in making them, and take great pride in their unique twist. Hiroshima style Okonomiyaki in particular is unique that below the typical
      Okonomiyaki layer composed of flour and egg batter with cabbages topped with sauce, they add Yakisoba(Japanese tyle stir-fried noodles).</p>
