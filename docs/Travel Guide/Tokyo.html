<div class='Text2'>
    <p>Although sushi might seem like a very generic food even in America, Tokyo is known for it's especially deicious sushi.
      Unlike American sushi, which are usually found and sold as "maki" (rolls), most sushi in Japan are sold as "nigiri" (fish over rice).</p>

    <img src='Tokyo Images/Ramen.jpg' width='750' alt='Japanese Style Ramen'/>

<div class='Text2'>
    <p>The ramen found in Japan, especially in Tokyo, is nothing like the ramen noodles we eat in the U.S. first, instead of the dried noodles that
      are heat up in boiling water, the ramen shops in Japan make them fresh. Ramen in Japan are composed of 5 components.
      They are the broth, tare(concentrated flavor that compliments the soup), noodles, toppings, and the oil(usually infused with aromatics).</p>

    <p>Yakitoris can not only be enjoyed as a popular street food item in the streets of Tokyo, but they can also be enjoyed in a gourmet fashion.
      Yakitoris are usually served by small portions of meat or vegetables (or both) skewered on a wooden stick that could be cooked by the customer
      via a charcoal grill or served already cooked.</p>

<div class='Text2'>
  </p>I know what you're thinking... out of all the things I could've included, why include a 7-11 in the list?! Also, what's a Lawson? Well... first off,
    the 7-11 in Japan are nothing like the ones found in the U.S! 7-11s in Japan not only offer much more varieties of snacks and drinks compared to our
    typical sodas and iced teas in American 7-11s, they also sell ready-to-eat meals! Some examples of meals sold in Japese 7-11s are bento boxes
     (lunch boxes usually composed of rice and side dishes), varieties of noodle dishes, onigiri(rice ball with filling inside), sandwiches, and many types
     of desserts. Lawson carries similar merchandise as Japanese 7-11s but are exclusive to Japan. </p>
